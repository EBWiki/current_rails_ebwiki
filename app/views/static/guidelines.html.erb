<h1>EBWiki Guidelines for Adding Content:</h1>
<h3>Volunteer Editors:</h3>
<p>Our goal is to gather comprehensive and accurate data on cases of overreach and abuse by law enforcement against people of color
    <%= link_to '(Read More on Our Mission)', about_path %>. We rely on the contributions of volunteer editors to make this happen. Anyone with web access can edit or create cases on EBWiki. These volunteer editors are also able to watch pages and where there are disagreements on how to present facts,
        editors work together to arrive at an case that fairly represents the current facts as they are known and evidenced by external sources.</p>

<h3>Adding content</h3>
<p>EBWiki allows one to add, edit, follow and unfollow an case and also add and update an agency.These are <%= link_to 'instructions on how to add and edit content on EBWiki.', instructions_path %> </p>

<h3>Other helpful features</h3>
<p>In addition to the Edit Button, there are two other buttons beneath the image on every case page. These are:</p>

<p><b>History</b>. This button allows readers to view the editors of the case and the changes that have been made over time.</p>

<p><b>Follow</b>. If you are logged in to your account, clicking on the follow button will cause any changes made to the case to be relayed to you via email updates. (Note: when this button is clicked, it changes to “Following”.)</p>

<p>Note: EBWiki keeps track of all changes made to cases. This means that poor-quality edits or vandalism can be reversed or brought up to an appropriate standard by any other editor.
    As a result, inexperienced editors cannot accidentally do permanent harm if they make a mistake while editing. Unintentional mistakes can be fixed quickly when discovered.
    Intentional vandalism can be reported and corrected by anyone.</p>

<h3>Intellectual Property:</h3>
<p>Contributions remain the property of their creators, while the CC-BY-SA and GFDL licenses ensure the content is freely distributable and reproducible.</p>
