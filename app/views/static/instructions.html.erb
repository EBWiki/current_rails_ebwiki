 <h1>Instructions:</h1>
 <p>Before beginning to contribute, however, please read these brief guidelines, as well as our about page. Depending on an case's demonstrated susceptibility to vandalism, according to its visibility or the degree of controversy surrounding the topic, the edit button may not be shown for all users. (Vandals are reported via email to blackopswiki1@gmail.com and may be temporarily blocked from editing EBWiki.)<br>

Most cases start as stubs, but after many contributions, they can become featured cases. In addition to research a case and writing an case themselves, users can write to us and request that we find out information on cases that we do not have listed.<br>

Above all, it is important to understand that in contributing to EBWiki, users are expected to be civil and factual, respecting all points of view, and only add verifiable and factual information rather than personal views and opinions. Verification includes cases, news stories and original documents. You can add as many links as you like to support your edits and additions.</p>
